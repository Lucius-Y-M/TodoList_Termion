# Terminal Todo List (Linux)
#### Submitted As CS50 Final Project
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/fuC1OXKuQYo
#### Description:

A simple Todo-List app in Linux Terminal, made in Rust with the termion crate.

The inspiration actually came from one of the streams of tsoding, an eccentric and lovely (well, in his own way) chap who knows programming like the back of his hand. In that stream he tried to implement exactly that: a terminal todo-list app in Rust, with the termion crate, but gave up due to what he perceived as unnecessary complexities and switched to another crate.

I had been following him up to that point in the stream. When he switched, I paused the stream and thought to myself: "Can I do this with the termion crate?" And the result is here before your eyes.

It is FAR from perfect, and there may even be small bugs here and there.

Currently, this is what it does:

- Adding items
- Marking items as complete
- Removing items

Nothing more, nothing less.
