# Terminal Todo List for Linux (Written in Rust with Termion)
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/fuC1OXKuQYo 
#### Description:

This is a simple Todo List Terminal, implemented in Rust using the Termion Crate, for Linux Systems.


I did this for Linux only because I wanted to push myself to doing more things in Linux and getting familiar with it.
The inspiration actually came from a programmer-streamer named TSODING.
He once streamed creating a Terminal TodoList App in Rust for Linux, and first tried to use Termion to do it, but then grew frustrated
and then changed to another crate (which is a wrapper around a C library, which he's more familiar with).

I asked myself: what if I pick up where he left off, and finish everything with Termion?
The answer is here before your eyes.

It supports:

- Navigating through items
- Adding new items
- Marking items as completed
- Deleting items
